The aim of the program is to find the last digit of a Fibonacci number.


The Naive Algorithm is to calculate the sum of all of Fibonacci numbers up to the desired one, then calclate the modulus of the total; and 
this wastes time and memory due to unnecassary calculations of large numbers which also causes overflow.

The Faster Algorithm calculates the modulus of each summation process as there is no need for the whole number.
